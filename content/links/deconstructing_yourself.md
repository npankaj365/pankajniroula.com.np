Decontructing Yourself is a rich resource centre full of inquiries into Mindfulness, Awakening and just the name itself "deconstructing yourself". Michael J. Taft writes "Deconstructing Yourself strives to encourage, inform, and inspire your meditation practice towards ongoing awakening."  and that is what I have found it interesting and useful to myself for.

The website is [Deconstructing Yourself](https://deconstructingyourself.com/) and the podcast is available through all major podcast players (also [here](https://deconstructingyourself.com/deconstructing-yourself-podcast) for web users).
