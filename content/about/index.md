This is Pankaj Niroula's corner of the web. Here I intend to share my thoughts, musings and interesting finds from the internet. To the extent I am able to, I intend to curate links that have benefitted me in hopes that someone else benefits from them too.

I will be sure to put more information in days to come. I'm publishing this site at the state it is in just to get this rolling.

For more information about who I am, you can take a look at my [LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/npankaj365)
