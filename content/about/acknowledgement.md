<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
Over the course of my life, I have immensely benefitted by the grace of the following humans' offerings. This list is for the remembrance of people that I have known for over 3 years who have at some point or continued to bless my life with their support, wisdom, companionship or presence. Who I am now and what I have become has been greatly shaped by them. I am sharing the list in hopes that more people can benefit from at least the public treasures.

<ul>
    <li>My parents and my brother for creating the conditions that I was born into and offering what they could offer.</li>
